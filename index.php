        <p>This website is made to educate you on the very basics of the guitar.
        </p>
        <p>
            A guitar is a fretted musical instrument that typipcally has 6 strings.You can play the instrument by either strumming or picking the strings. You use you left hand on the notes and your right hand 
            for strumming or picking. The sound of a guitar can be either projected from it acoustically or amplifed(electronic pickup). The standard tuning for a guitar is E, A, D, G, B, E. You may notice
            that the strings on the top are different to the bottom strings. Starting from the thinnest string, the strings are called string 1, string 2, and so on up until string 6(the topmost string). String 1 and 2 are called
            "plain strings" and are bare steel strings. Strings 3 through 6 are wound with metal. As strings become shorter their pitch increases. Guitars are designed to incorporate this method so that
            the pitch they produce increases a semitone each time the position of the string is held at change. The metallic parts that are on the neck are called frets. A player uses their left hand to hold 
            the strings down in the space between the frets. There is a total of 20 frets for 20 semitones. Guitar was

        <p> Guitar is quite hard when you don't know what you need or what you are doing. It will take some time before you become a pro, which won't happen over night. As a beginner you probally would not know what tabs were or even how to hold a guitar. Lots of videos online 
          don't have a good enought views of how you hold a pick or they don't explain it quite right.
        </p>
        <p>Before you buy a guitar online go inside a guitar store and have a hold and feel of the guitars. This is quite important because you may end up getting a guitar you are not happy with.
          As a beginner you would probally want a guitar with softer strings(nylon). This is because nylon is softer on your fingers than steel and other forms of strings. This all depeneds on how thick 
          your fingers are, so you might be alright with a steel strung guitar. Another thing to note when buying a guitar is that they come in different sizes eg. 1/4, 1/2, 3/3 and full size.
          <li> 1/4 is made for about 2-5 year olds</li><li>1/2 is made for 5-8 year olds.</li> <li>3/4 size is made for 8-12 year olds.</li><li> Full size is made for 12+</li>
