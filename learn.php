<h2><u>What is the best guitars for beginner</u></h2>
<p>Well that varies from person to person due to different heigt sizes ,body sizes, finger thickness, hand size and musical tastes. It is reccomened when first learning guitar you get an acoustic guitar that has 
    nylon strings because nylon is softer than steel strings. Another thing to note is that electric guitar require an amp to make sound come out of them. You can buy an acoustic electirc guitar 
    that you can use with iver an amp or not. But when buying a guitar its up to you in the end and what you think feels better.
